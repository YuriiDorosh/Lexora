### M1 — Core Module Scaffold + Auth

**Status:** Complete and verified.
**Started:** 2026-04-13
**Completed:** 2026-04-13

#### Sub-steps completed

- [x] Create 11 module scaffolds (manifests, __init__ files, security CSVs, views dirs)
  - All modules in `src/addons/language_*` created with `__init__.py`, `__manifest__.py`,
    `models/__init__.py`, `security/ir.model.access.csv`, `views/`, `data/`, `tests/`
- [x] `language_security`: security groups XML + auto-assignment hook on res.users
  - Three groups defined: `group_language_user`, `group_language_moderator`, `group_language_admin`
  - Implication chain: moderator → user; admin → moderator (ADR-004)
  - Auto-assignment via `implied_ids` on `base.group_portal` (no code hook needed)
  - `password_security` declared as dependency
- [x] `language_core`: system parameters XML + job status mixin + RabbitMQ publisher stub
  - `ir.config_parameter`: `language.pvp.min_entries=10`, `language.audio.max_upload_bytes=10485760`
  - `language.job.status.mixin` abstract model: `job_id`, `status`, `error_message`, helpers
  - `RabbitMQPublisher` stub class with `publish(event_type, payload, job_id)` interface
  - `web_notify` declared as dependency
- [x] Tests for language_security (groups exist, implication chain, portal signup hook)
  - `language_security/tests/test_security_groups.py`: 3 tests
- [x] Tests for language_core (system parameter defaults + mixin)
  - `language_core/tests/test_system_parameters.py`: 2 tests
  - `language_core/tests/test_job_status_mixin.py`: 2 tests
- [x] Verify all modules install cleanly via --init
  - 55 modules loaded (11 custom + 44 pulled-in deps), 0 errors
  - All 7 tests pass, 0 failures

#### Verification steps passed

- [x] All 11 `language_*` modules install via `--init --no-http --stop-after-init` — 0 errors
- [x] All 7 tests pass (language_security: 3, language_core: 4) — 0 failures
- Note: manual "Register portal user → confirm Language User group" is the remaining human
  verification step; automated tests confirm the implied_ids mechanism is in place.

#### Decisions made during M1

- **Auto-assignment via XML `implied_ids`**: `base.group_portal.implied_ids` includes
  `group_language_user`. This is the idiomatic Odoo approach; no Python `res.users.create()`
  override needed. Simpler, no risk of missing portal signup edge cases.
- **OCA addons as manifest deps**: `password_security` → `language_security`;
  `web_notify` → `language_core`; `base_search_fuzzy` → `language_words`;
  `website_require_login` + `website_menu_by_user_status` → `language_portal`.
  Ensures they install when our modules install without needing to list them separately in
  the `--init` command.
- **`--no-http` required for CLI init/test while Odoo service is running**: Port 8069 is
  held by the main Odoo process. All `--stop-after-init` and `--test-enable` commands must
  include `--no-http`. Document this in the M2 verification section.

#### Known limitations at M1 exit

- All language_* modules except language_security and language_core are pure stubs (no models
  or views yet). They install cleanly but do nothing.
- Manual human verification pending: register a portal user via the web UI and confirm they
  appear in `group_language_user` in the Odoo backend.

### M0 — Infrastructure Foundation

**Status:** Complete and verified by user.
**Completed:** 2026-04-13

#### Sub-steps completed

- [x] Created `docker_compose/redis/docker-compose.yml`
  - Redis 7-alpine, AOF persistence, no password (dev default)
- [x] Created `docker_compose/rabbitmq/docker-compose.yml`
  - RabbitMQ 3-management, ports 5672 + 15672
  - Credentials: `${RABBITMQ_USER:-guest}` / `${RABBITMQ_PASS:-guest}`, overridable via `.env`
- [x] Created `services/translation/` — FastAPI stub, `/health` endpoint
- [x] Created `services/llm/` — FastAPI stub, `/health` endpoint
- [x] Created `services/anki/` — FastAPI stub, `/health` endpoint
- [x] Created `services/audio/` — FastAPI stub, `/health` endpoint
- [x] Created `docker_compose/translation/` — Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml, port 8001
- [x] Created `docker_compose/llm/` — Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml, port 8002
- [x] Created `docker_compose/anki/` — Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml, port 8003
- [x] Created `docker_compose/audio/` — Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml, port 8004
- [x] Updated `src/configs/odoo.conf`: `workers = 3` → `workers = 4`
- [x] Updated `Makefile`: added `up-dev`, `down-dev`, per-service up/down/logs targets for rabbitmq/translation/llm/anki/audio, and `up-*-no-cache` variants
- [x] Updated `env.example`: added `RABBITMQ_USER/PASS/VHOST/HOST/PORT` and `REDIS_HOST/PORT`
- [x] Fixed `docs/PLAN.md` M0 verification commands: Odoo port 8069 → 5433 (nginx-exposed)

#### Verification steps passed (confirmed by user)

- [x] `make up-dev` — all services start without errors
- [x] `http://localhost:15672` — RabbitMQ management UI accessible
- [x] `docker exec redis redis-cli ping` — returns PONG
- [x] `http://localhost:8001/health` — `{"status":"ok","service":"translation"}`
- [x] `http://localhost:8002/health` — `{"status":"ok","service":"llm"}`
- [x] `http://localhost:8003/health` — `{"status":"ok","service":"anki"}`
- [x] `http://localhost:8004/health` — `{"status":"ok","service":"audio"}`
- [x] `http://localhost:5433` — Odoo setup wizard accessible via nginx

#### Decisions made during M0

- **Workers = 4**: nginx already routes `/websocket` → `odoo:8072`; no nginx change needed.
- **Build context `../..`** for all worker Dockerfiles: follows existing Odoo/nginx pattern; source code lives in `services/<name>/`.
- **No `env_file` in worker composes yet**: stubs have no env-var dependencies. Add `env_file: ../../.env` to each worker compose when real RabbitMQ consumers are implemented (M3–M6).
- **Redis no-password for dev**: acceptable; production will need `requirepass`.
- **`elasticsearch==9.1.1` left in `base-requirements.txt`**: not blocking; can be removed in M1 cleanup.

#### Known limitations at M0 exit

- Worker services are stubs only; no RabbitMQ consumers yet.
- Odoo database not initialised; `/web/health` requires setup wizard completion.
- No Odoo custom modules installed yet (begins M1).

## How to use this file

### Starting a new milestone

Add a block at the top under "Current Milestone":

```markdown
### M<N> — <Name>

**Status:** In progress
**Started:** <date>

#### Sub-steps

- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2
...

#### Verification steps passed

(none yet)

#### Decisions made during this milestone

(none yet)

#### Blockers

(none)
```

### During implementation

After completing each sub-step, change `[ ]` to `[x]` and add a one-line note if a decision was made.
After each verification step passes, mark it under "Verification steps passed."
If a blocker is encountered, add it under "Blockers" with a short description and whether it is resolved.

### Completing a milestone

1. Mark all sub-steps and verifications complete.
2. Move the completed block to "Completed Milestones."
3. Reset "Current Milestone" to "None in progress."
4. Commit `docs/TASKS.md` together with the final sub-step of the milestone.
