# Lexora — Active Task Tracker

> **Purpose:** Canonical resume point for interrupted implementation sessions.
> Read this first when continuing work mid-milestone.
>
> **Update discipline:** Update this file after each meaningful sub-step — not only at the end of
> a milestone. A sub-step is meaningful if skipping its record would cause a future session to
> re-implement it or miss it.
>
> **Scope:** Covers the current or most recently active milestone only.
> When a milestone is verified complete, archive it in the "Completed Milestones" section below
> and start a fresh "Current Milestone" block.

## Current Milestone

None in progress. M0 is complete. Awaiting confirmation to begin M1.

## Completed Milestones

### M0 — Infrastructure Foundation

**Status:** Complete and verified by user.
**Completed:** 2026-04-13

#### Sub-steps completed

- [x] Created `docker_compose/redis/docker-compose.yml`
  - Redis 7-alpine, AOF persistence, no password (dev default)
- [x] Created `docker_compose/rabbitmq/docker-compose.yml`
  - RabbitMQ 3-management, ports 5672 + 15672
  - Credentials: `${RABBITMQ_USER:-guest}` / `${RABBITMQ_PASS:-guest}`, overridable via `.env`
- [x] Created `services/translation/` — FastAPI stub, `/health` endpoint
- [x] Created `services/llm/` — FastAPI stub, `/health` endpoint
- [x] Created `services/anki/` — FastAPI stub, `/health` endpoint
- [x] Created `services/audio/` — FastAPI stub, `/health` endpoint
- [x] Created `docker_compose/translation/` — Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml, port 8001
- [x] Created `docker_compose/llm/` — Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml, port 8002
- [x] Created `docker_compose/anki/` — Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml, port 8003
- [x] Created `docker_compose/audio/` — Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml, port 8004
- [x] Updated `src/configs/odoo.conf`: `workers = 3` → `workers = 4`
- [x] Updated `Makefile`: added `up-dev`, `down-dev`, per-service up/down/logs targets for rabbitmq/translation/llm/anki/audio, and `up-*-no-cache` variants
- [x] Updated `env.example`: added `RABBITMQ_USER/PASS/VHOST/HOST/PORT` and `REDIS_HOST/PORT`
- [x] Fixed `docs/PLAN.md` M0 verification commands: Odoo port 8069 → 5433 (nginx-exposed)

#### Verification steps passed (confirmed by user)

- [x] `make up-dev` — all services start without errors
- [x] `http://localhost:15672` — RabbitMQ management UI accessible
- [x] `docker exec redis redis-cli ping` — returns PONG
- [x] `http://localhost:8001/health` — `{"status":"ok","service":"translation"}`
- [x] `http://localhost:8002/health` — `{"status":"ok","service":"llm"}`
- [x] `http://localhost:8003/health` — `{"status":"ok","service":"anki"}`
- [x] `http://localhost:8004/health` — `{"status":"ok","service":"audio"}`
- [x] `http://localhost:5433` — Odoo setup wizard accessible via nginx

#### Decisions made during M0

- **Workers = 4**: nginx already routes `/websocket` → `odoo:8072`; no nginx change needed.
- **Build context `../..`** for all worker Dockerfiles: follows existing Odoo/nginx pattern; source code lives in `services/<name>/`.
- **No `env_file` in worker composes yet**: stubs have no env-var dependencies. Add `env_file: ../../.env` to each worker compose when real RabbitMQ consumers are implemented (M3–M6).
- **Redis no-password for dev**: acceptable; production will need `requirepass`.
- **`elasticsearch==9.1.1` left in `base-requirements.txt`**: not blocking; can be removed in M1 cleanup.

#### Known limitations at M0 exit

- Worker services are stubs only; no RabbitMQ consumers yet.
- Odoo database not initialised; `/web/health` requires setup wizard completion.
- No Odoo custom modules installed yet (begins M1).

## How to use this file

### Starting a new milestone

Add a block at the top under "Current Milestone":

```markdown
### M<N> — <Name>

**Status:** In progress
**Started:** <date>

#### Sub-steps

- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2
...

#### Verification steps passed

(none yet)

#### Decisions made during this milestone

(none yet)

#### Blockers

(none)
```

### During implementation

After completing each sub-step, change `[ ]` to `[x]` and add a one-line note if a decision was made.
After each verification step passes, mark it under "Verification steps passed."
If a blocker is encountered, add it under "Blockers" with a short description and whether it is resolved.

### Completing a milestone

1. Mark all sub-steps and verifications complete.
2. Move the completed block to "Completed Milestones."
3. Reset "Current Milestone" to "None in progress."
4. Commit `docs/TASKS.md` together with the final sub-step of the milestone.
